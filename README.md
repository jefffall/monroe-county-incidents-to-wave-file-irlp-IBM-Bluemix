# monroe-county-incidents-to-wave-file-irlp-IBM-Bluemix

This code can be used on an IRLP repeater node to scrape police incidents from the Monroe County Police blotter website.

The incidents will be made into a wave file via IBM bluemix and then the transmitter or link will be keyed and the incident announced.

This assumes you have root access to the IRLP node and can add these files and set up cron.

This code is directly useful for the Monroe County Police, Fire incidents on the Monroe County Incidents page here:
